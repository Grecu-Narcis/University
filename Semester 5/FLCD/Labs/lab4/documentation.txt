The FiniteAutomata class represents a finite automaton initialized from a configuration file. It reads and stores the automaton's states, alphabet, start state, final states, and transitions. The __init__() method initializes the automaton by parsing the file, while the __split_values() static method is used to parse semicolon-separated values from the file. The accepts_word() method checks if a given word is accepted by the automaton by simulating its transitions based on the input. Transitions between states are represented by Transition objects.
