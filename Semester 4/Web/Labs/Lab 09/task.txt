Solve the following problem using the JSP/Servlet technology. State information (between web requests) is always stored in a database; you may store some state information in cookies/session objects. Write a web application which allows a user to play the game snake/worm. Each move of the work is stored in the database. The server keeps track of the time spent by the user in the game. There should be some obstacles on the play grid (some cells of the grid should be avoided by the snake/worm). Users must authenticate themselfs prior to entering the game (based on username/password).
