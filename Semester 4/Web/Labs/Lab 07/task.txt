Write a web application for an e-commerce store. The application should maintain information about the products it sells in the database. The user should browse products by categories (use AJAX for this), add and remove products to a shopping cart. Product browsing should be paged - products are displayed on pages with maximum 4 products on a page (you should be able to go to the previous and the next page).
